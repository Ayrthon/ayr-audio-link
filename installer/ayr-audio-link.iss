; Inno Setup 6 — AYR Audio Link (sender)
;
; Build (from repo root):
;   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File installer\build-link-installer.ps1
;
; The sender is a free companion to AYR Audio Meter. It captures audio from a
; chosen input or WASAPI loopback device and streams it to any AYR Audio Meter
; running on the same LAN. The meter discovers senders via mDNS and shows
; them as `[NET] <name>` entries in its device dropdown.

#define MyAppURL         "https://ayrthon.com"
#define MyAppExeName     "AYR Audio Link.exe"
; Reuse the meter's icon for visual consistency — both apps ship under the
; same "AYR Audio" brand. A separate per-product icon can be dropped in here
; later without touching the build script.

[Setup]
; Unique to the sender. Never reuse the Meter's AppId here — Inno uses it to
; key upgrades / uninstalls, and collisions would have the two products

[Run]
; --- Windows Firewall rule ---------------------------------------------
; Remove any stale rule from a previous install first so we never end up
; with duplicates after upgrades (netsh silently appends otherwise). The
; delete step is `runhidden` + allowed to fail (initial install has nothing
; to delete).

; Open inbound TCP on the default Link port. The sender is a local-LAN
; broadcast tool — we intentionally scope to `profile=private,domain` so
; a roaming user on a coffee-shop Wi-Fi doesn't accept unsolicited
; connections from strangers. Users who need `public` can open the rule
; manually; the risk case is unusual enough that the default here should
; stay conservative.
